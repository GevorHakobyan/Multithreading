# Multithreading
# About
I have created reusible Thread pool, by which you can perform different tasks
at runtime you can give different tools to thread pool and it will use them to perform tasks
for example first I give merge_sort, which sorts the array
then I change it's tool to fiel creator which creates file and writes the content of sorted array into that file
some basic mutlithreading tools are used though.
